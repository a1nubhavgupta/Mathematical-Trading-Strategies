### I have calculated the correlation first of nasdaq and se and found that a lead lag relationship between them which suggest that the changes that happen in nasdaq today would be similiar to that of nse 20 days later , after which I coded keltner channel , bollinder bands , macd  indicator and tried to optimise the paramaters of indicators on nasdaq and put these optimised indicator into use to calculate the buy and sell signals and dates of nse based on the indicators and recorded the results
